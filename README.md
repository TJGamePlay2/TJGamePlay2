## Hi there 👋

Hello! My name is TJ (he/him). I am studying Computer Engineering at the University of South Florida.

I have a huge interest in both backend and frontend software development as well as creating hardware. Currently studying for Azure, AWS, and CompTia certifications as well as Python and web development.

I'm hoping to learn a lot about these topics and make cool things!
